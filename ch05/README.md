# Chapter 05 Trees, SECU201-18S

## Task 04: The Satisfiability Problem
In the textbook (or the lecture 17 slides), you can find the satisfiability problem (SAT). You should write a program to check all possible combinations for the given propositional expression (or formula) using the binary tree structure and the postorder traversal.

The expression uses three operators:
1. & (and), which is the substitution of ∧
2. | (or), which is the substitution of ∨, and
3. ! (not), which is the substitution of ￢.

Your program should read the expression from the standard input, and the resulting checklist should be printed into the standard output. Since the expression needs a kind of parsing algorithm, you should consult with Chapter 4 of the textbook.

This task should be done until 23:59 May 22, 2018 (석가탄신일) and the code should be uploaded in this GitHub repository. As usual, no credit is given for delayed submissions. Also, the path of your code should be https://github.com/rohnugu/secu201-18s/ch05/task04/sat_201727####.c where # means a decimal digit so that 201727#### represents your student no.
