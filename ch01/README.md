# Chapter 01 Basic Concepts, SECU201-18S

## Task 01: Learn Git and Github basics
In the textbook (or the lecture 1 slides), you can find the source code of Example 1.1 (Selection sort).
You should type, build, and run the code under your Git local repository, and upload your code into this remote GitHub repository.
(You should not commit and push the executable binary to this remote Github repository!)
After this task, the path of your code should be https://github.com/rohnugu/secu201-18s/ch01/task01/selsort_201727####.c where # means a decimal digit so that 201727#### represents your student no.

You can easily find great Git/GitHub guides by googling, but the following links may reduce your burden:

If you are not familiar with command user interface (CUI), consider to use the following GUI tools.
1. GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com (Very easy, but you cannot work with other Git repository...)
2. Sourcetree: https://ko.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree (A widely used GUI Git client for Windows and Mac)
3. TortoiseGit: https://tortoisegit.org/ (Just for Windows but it is integrated with Windows Shell Interface - that is, you can use git in File Explorer.)

Some important comments:
* Since this repository is owned by the lecturer, you must let the lecturer know your GitHub ID (i.e., username). Please e-mail your GitHub ID to the lecturer. After the lecturer add your ID as a collaborator, you can push your code.
* Please the relative path (상대경로) of your local repository and the remote Github repository. For example, suppose that the root directory of your local repository is C:\johndoe\gitroot. Then you should write your code into C:\johndoe\gitroot\ch01\task01, since the root directory of the remote Github repository is https://github.com/rohnugu/secu201-18s.
