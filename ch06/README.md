## Task 05: Implementing Graph Algroithms
In Lecture 22 and 23 (or Chapter 6 of the textbook), we covered two algorithms for the Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree (MST) problem, and two algortihms for the Single Source/All Destination Shortest Path problem. You should write a program for MST problem and a program for the shortest path problem.

For MST problem, you can choose one of the following algorithms (with the corresponding filename):
- Kruskal's Algorithm (Level: Hard): kruskal
- Prim's Algorithm (Level: Intermediate): prim
- Sollin's Algorithm (Level: Hard): sollin

For the shortest path problem, you can choose one of the following algorithms:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (Level: Intermediate): dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford Algorthm (Level: Intermediate): bellman
- Floyd-Warsall Algorithm (Level: Intermediate): floyd

To implement the programs, you may need to choose a graph representation. To reduce your burden, it is recommended to use a simple adjacency matrix as the input. The outputs of the programs should be sufficient to solve the problem.

This task should be done until 23:59 June 19, 2018 and the code should be uploaded in this GitHub repository. As usual, no credit is given for delayed submissions. Also, the path of your code should be https://github.com/rohnugu/secu201-18s/ch06/task05/201727####/$.c where # means a decimal digit so that 201727#### represents your student no. and $ means the name of used algorithm.
